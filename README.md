# Employment and Wage Trends Across Industries (2020–2022)

This repository contains the final project submitted for **DSCI 5260: Business Process Analytics** under the guidance of **Professor Dr. Sameh Shamroukh**. The project investigates employment and wage patterns across industries using the **Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)** dataset from 2020 to 2022.

## 📊 Project Overview

The U.S. labor market experienced significant transformations during 2020–2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, rising automation, inflation, and remote work adoption. This project explores these dynamics with a focus on:

- Sector-wise wage growth and employment shifts
- Public vs private sector disparities
- Impacts of remote work and automation
- Wage sustainability and economic inequality

## 📂 Contents

## 📌 Key Findings

- 💼 **Highest Wage Growth** was seen in technical sectors like aerospace and automotive manufacturing.
- 🧑‍🔬 **Healthcare and Tech** sectors showed resilient employment growth.
- 💸 **Wage inequality** persisted, especially among women and minority groups.
- 🏛️ **Public sector** wages were more stable but grew slower than private sector wages.
- ⚙️ **Automation** and **remote work** redefined workforce composition and job security.

## 📈 Methods Used

- Descriptive statistics and outlier removal (IQR)
- Correlation analysis (Pearson, Chi-Square)
- ANOVA and t-tests for hypothesis testing
- Time-series visualizations and wage growth calculations
- Regression modeling and industry comparisons

## 🎯 Research Questions

1. What factors influenced employment and wage trends between 2020–2022?
2. How do public and private sectors differ in wage progression and job stability?
3. What are the long-term effects of automation and remote work on employment?
4. How do inflation and minimum wage policy affect real income?
